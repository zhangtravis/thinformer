# Thinformer

**Thinformer** provides a fast, high-quality approximation to the scaled dot-product attention mechanism in Transformers.

For a detailed description of the **Thinformer** algorithm and its strong approximation guarantees, see [Low-Rank Thinning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12063).

## Getting Started
To install the `thinformer` package, use the following pip command:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/microsoft/thinformer.git
```

Then, simply use `ThinformerAttention` as a drop-in replacement for a standard attention layer:

```python
from thinformer import ThinformerAttention

attention_layer = ThinformerAttention()

# Assumes:
# - query has shape (B, T, H, E)
# - key has shape (B, S, H, E)
# - value has shape (B, S, H, D)

attn_output, attn_output_weights = attention_layer(query, key, value)
```

For an example usage, see our [T2T-ViT ImageNet classification experiments](./examples/t2t/README.md).

This package has been tested with the following operating system, Python, and PyTorch combinations:
- Ubuntu 20.04, Python 3.12.9, Torch 2.4.0
- Ubuntu 20.04, Python 3.12.9, Torch 2.6.0
- Ubuntu 22.04.5, Python 3.12.9, Torch 2.8.0
